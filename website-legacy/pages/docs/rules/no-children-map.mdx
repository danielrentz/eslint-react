# no-children-map

## Rule category

Restriction.

## What it does

Prevents the use of `Children.map` from the `react` package.

## Why is this bad?

Using `Children` is uncommon and can lead to fragile code. [See common alternatives](https://react.dev/reference/react/Children#alternatives).

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx
import React, { Children } from "react";

interface ExampleProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

function Example({ children }: ExampleProps) {
  return (
    <div className="RowList">
      {Children.map(children, (child) => (
        <div className="Row">{child}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
