# no-unsafe-iframe-sandbox

## Rule category

Security.

## What it does

Enforces `sandbox` attribute for `iframe` elements is not set to unsafe combinations.

## Why is this bad?

If `sandbox` attribute is not set, the iframe content can have abilities that are not intended to be allowed.

## Examples

This rule reports cases where attribute contains `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` at the same time as this combination allows the embedded document to remove the sandbox attribute and bypass the restrictions.

### Failing

```tsx
import React from "react";

function Example() {
  return (
    <iframe
      src="https://example.com"
      sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
    />
  );
}
```

### Passing

```tsx
import React from "react";

function Example() {
  return <iframe src="https://example.com" sandbox="allow-popups" />;
}
```
