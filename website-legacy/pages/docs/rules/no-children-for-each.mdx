# no-children-for-each

## Rule category

Restriction.

## What it does

Prevents the use of `Children.forEach` from the `react` package.

## Why is this bad?

Using `Children` is uncommon and can lead to fragile code. [See common alternatives](https://react.dev/reference/react/Children#alternatives).

## Examples

### Failing

```tsx
import React, { Children } from "react";

interface ExampleProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

function Example({ children }: ExampleProps) {
  const result = [];
  Children.forEach(children, (child, index) => {
    result.push(child);
    result.push(<hr key={index} />);
  });
  // ...
}
```
